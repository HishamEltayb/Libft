<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## LIBFT

C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful standard functions.
This project is about understanding the way these functions work, implementing and learning to use them. You will create your own library.

Use the `libft.pdf` to get started.
